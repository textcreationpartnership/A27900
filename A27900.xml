            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IT is ſo unuſual in this Age, to confer Benefits unſought, eſpecially ſuch as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was pleaſed lately to think me worthy of; that I ought to have <pb facs="tcp:40241:3"/>the higher eſteem, not merely of your Lordſhip's ſingular kindneſs to me, but chiefly of that noble principle of Vertue in your mind from whence it purely flowed. Which will excuſe, I hope, the preſumption of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication; to which I am prompted by nothing, but onely an eager deſire, publickly to teſtifie my gratitude to your Lordſhip, as ſoon as it was poſſible. Which made me lay hold upon the very firſt opportunity, that preſented it ſelf: and chuſe rather to prefix your Lordſhip's great Name, to the remainder of this Work (part of which was publiſhed ſome months ago) then let any thing appear in the world under my name, which did not carry along with it a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acknowledgment of my obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <pb facs="tcp:40241:3"/>to your Lordſhip. To whoſe Judgment knowing perſons attribute ſo much; that as it is a very great honour to receive any mark of your Lordſhip's good opinion, ſo it is a preferment to which, whether I will or no, your Lordſhip hath advanced me.</p>
            <p>I will endeavour not to fall from it by forgetfulneſs of your Lordſhip's favours; but preſerve ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them, as is ſutable to the preſent ſenſe I have of them: which is as much beyond what I can expreſs, as they are beyond what I could deſerve.</p>
            <p>The beſt expreſſion I can make of it will be in my prayers to God, that, as the King hath made you the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Diſpenſer of his Juſtice to his <pb facs="tcp:40241:4"/>People, and his Divine Majeſty hath made you a great Pattern of Piety and Devotion, as well as other exemplary Vertues; ſo, He would be pleaſed to give you wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and prudence to conduct your ſelf with ſuch dexterity as well as integrity in the management of all the publick Buſineſs, with the care of which you are intruſted, that you may continue (as you are) a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter of the Government, a Patron of Religion, a Friend of good Men, and, in a word, a Bleſſing, not onely to your own vertuous Family but, to the whole Nation. For, though there are ſome ſo imperfect, that they will allow no ſuch words to be ſaid of any, but thoſe that pleaſe them in every thing; yet, the moſt <pb facs="tcp:40241:4"/>of good Men, or at leaſt the beſt, will thankfully acknowledge the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs we enjoy in the Authority your Lordſhip hath, and will joyn in thoſe Prayers with,</p>

                     <p>Here begins a new Collection of XVII. Pſalms, moſt of them very diſconſolate and full of ſad Complaints, which make up the
<hi>Third</hi> Book of this Volume, as the Hebrews divide it. They were moſt of them compoſed by <hi>Aſaph</hi> (and but one of them by <hi>David</hi>) though who he was, is not reſolved by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters: who ſuſpect indeed there might be another Authour of ſome of theſe Pſalms; but have no other
<hi>Aſaph</hi> to name, but <hi>Aſaph the Singer,</hi> who was famous in the days of <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> VI. 39. XVI. 5. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> V. 12. And accordingly <hi>Apollinarius</hi> thus <pb n="2" facs="tcp:40241:6"/>deſcants upon the Title, <hi>The Divine inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> David <hi>failing in the compoſing of Songs,</hi> Aſaph <hi>aroſe and by the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reſounded this Hymn.</hi> But it ſeems to me that there is another perſon of this name mentioned in the holy Books (who may be more probably intituled to this Work) called <hi>Aſaph the Seer</hi> (ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> L.) who lived in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXIX. 30. and whoſe Son, I ſuppoſe, was then Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 2 <hi>King.</hi> XVIII. 37. XXXVI.
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 3. Some of them indeed (as I ſhall take notice in due place) may be thought rather to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to another <hi>Aſaph</hi> in after times: but for the preſent Pſalm (and moſt of the reſt) I can find no perſon ſo likely to whom it may be intituled, as him now named: who compoſed it, I conceive, either when he ſaw the miſerable havock which Strangers made among them in the days of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXVIII. 17, 18, 19. XXIX. 8, 9. or when <hi>Senacherib</hi> invaded them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the reformation which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had made: or, which is moſt probable, upon the occaſion that <hi>David</hi> wrote the XXXVII. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> to comfort himſelf and good men, when they ſaw the lewder ſort among them thrive and proſper; and the pious ſometimes ſorely afflicted: quite contrary to the Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Law, which promiſed all good things to thoſe that obſerved it; and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the evil to thoſe that broke it. This <pb n="3" facs="tcp:40241:6"/>extreamly afflicted his Spirit, and ſtaggered his Faith, till he conſidered the matter more deeply; and then he broke out into this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, ſaying,</p>

                     <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
                     <p>The deſolation of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and of the Temple, as well as the reſt of the Country, made by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> was the ſad occaſion of this Pſalm. For it is altogether improbable, that it hath reſpect to the days of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> as ſome fancy; becauſe, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> perrinently notes (to omit all other reaſons) we reade nothing in any Hiſtory of his burning the Temple, or ſo much as of his laying the City waſte; which are both here moſt ſorrowfully bewailed by <hi>Aſaph.</hi> Who was not therefore that <hi>Aſaph</hi> in <hi>David</hi>'s time (unleſs we ſhould grant him to have written by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prophecy, and predicted what ſhould be in after-times, as a great many think) becauſe there was no ſuch Temple in thoſe days, nor had been, as is here deſcribed: Nor was it
<hi>Aſaph</hi> the Seer in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s days (of whom ſee Argument of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Pſalm) who ſaw no ſuch deſolation made by
<hi>Senacherib</hi> (for he did not take <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nor ſhoot ſo much as an arrow into it) nor, in all likelihood, propheſied of the deſtruction here ſpoken of; becauſe <pb n="15" facs="tcp:40241:12"/>the deſcription of it in this Pſalm is ſo plain, that we may moſt reaſonably think the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of it had it before his eyes, and did not merely ſee it by the ſpirit of Prophecy; which is not wont to foretell things in ſo clear a manner, but more obſcurely and darkly.</p>
                     <p>I conclude therefore it was ſome other <hi>Aſaph</hi> who compoſed this Pſalm, in the time of the Captivity, and in the middle, or rather toward the concluſion of it; becauſe he complains, Ver. 9. that they had no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet (as there was in the beginning of the Captivity, particularly <hi>Jeremiah</hi>) to tell them how long it ſhould laſt. And conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Verſe he ſpeaks of himſelf as one that dwelt ſtill in the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> pointing to Mount
<hi>Sion</hi> as a place near to him; I take him to have been ſome pious man of the poſterity of <hi>Aſaph,</hi> who was ſuffered to remain there with the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if it were fit to ſuppoſe him to have written this Pſalm very young, and to have lived to a great age, when I have no proof of either; I ſhould gueſs him to be <hi>Aſaph</hi> the Keeper of the King's Forreſt, in the days of <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> who deſired <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to write to him, to furniſh him with Timber out of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> for the rebuilding ſome of thoſe places, which the Pſalmiſt here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains were deſtroyed. Among which, the <pb n="16" facs="tcp:40241:13"/>Porch of the Court of the Sanctuary remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unbuilt even unto thoſe times.</p>
                     <p>Howſoever from the mention of Mount <hi>Sion</hi> in the
<hi>ſecond</hi> Verſe, it is manifeſt <hi>Grotius</hi> forgot himſelf, when, in his Notes upon Ver. 6. he applies this Pſalm to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Shiloh;</hi> which he ſuppoſes <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaph</hi> to have here bewailed. For Mount <hi>Sion</hi> had then never been in their poſſeſſion, as it was afterward, and had lain ſo long waſte (Ver.
3.) when <hi>Aſaph</hi> wrote this Pſalm, that it look'd like a perpetual deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Beſides the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was not burnt when
<hi>Shiloh</hi> was deſtroyed, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, though without the Ark, till the days of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 2 Chron. I. 3. ſee <hi>Pſalm</hi> LXVIII. And of the meaning of <hi>Maſchil,</hi> ſee <hi>Pſalm</hi> XXXII.</p>

                     <p>When God gave his Law to the Iſraelites, He commanded them, not onely to be carefull to ſtudy it themſelves but, to inculcate it upon their Children (as the Pſalmiſt here remembers, Ver. 5.) that they might propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the knowledge of it to all future genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, IV.
<hi>Deut.</hi> 9. VI. 7, 8, <hi>&amp;c</hi> XI. 18, 19, <hi>&amp;c</hi> And particularly to inſtruct them in the reaſon of their Feaſts; which were appointed for the commemoration of ſeveral benefits, which he would not have forgotten, XIII. <hi>Exod.</hi> 8, 14. In proſecution of which end, as
<hi>Theodoret</hi> well obſerves, this Pſalm was indited, by the Prophetical grace; (as his words are) that they and all their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, might preſerve in mind the wonderfull works of God. An Epitome of which (for the help of their memory) He here preſents them withall; from the time of their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> till <hi>David</hi>'s promotion to the Throne.</p>
                     <p>Where this Narration concluding, it makes it probable this Pſalm was compoſed by that <hi>Aſaph,</hi> ſo often mentioned, as one of the principal Singers in thoſe days: who, ſetting
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40241:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>before the peoples eyes, as in a Table, the benefits their Fathers had received, with their ſhamefull ingratitude, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted upon them for it, teaches and inſtructs them who ſucceeded (for which reaſon ſome will have it called <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chil:</hi> ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> XXXII.) to learn greater gratitude and fidelity to their Benefactour: for fear they ſhould incur his higher diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if they did not beware by ſuch ſad Examples.</p>

                     <p>This Pſalm is ſomething of kin to the former; deprecating the diſpleaſure of the Almighty in a time of great calamity. Which, as all that I have met withall think, was either in <pb n="82" facs="tcp:40241:48"/>the captivity of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> by
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> or of the Ten Tribes, by <hi>Salmanaſſar.</hi> But it ſeems to me rather to have been penned between theſe two, in the time of
<hi>Hezekiah:</hi> who had wrote a Letter you find (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXXI. 6.) to the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that were eſcaped out of the hand of the King of
<hi>Aſſyria;</hi> eſpecially to <hi>Ephraim</hi> and
<hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> the Tribes neareſt to them, that they would come to the Houſe of the Lord at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and keep the Paſſover with them: which ſummons, ſeveral of them obeyed, Ver. 11. 18. and kept the Feaſt as long again as they were wont, Ver. 23. And when this was finiſhed, they all went through the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and threw down all the High places and Altars that they found: not onely in <hi>Judah;</hi> but in <hi>Benjamin</hi> alſo, <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeh,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXXI.
1.</p>
                     <p>But after this happy ſettlement you reade there, XXXII. 1. that the Land was inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Senacherib,</hi> and ſorely diſtreſſed; to the great diſcouragement no doubt of thoſe, who had joined in the Reformation: which moved <hi>Aſaph</hi> (mentioned 2
<hi>Chron.</hi> XXIX. 30. ſee the Argument of LXXIII. <hi>Pſal.</hi>) moſt earneſtly to beſeech God (Ver. 2. of this Pſalm) that he would be pleaſed to ſtir up Himſelf before <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and
<hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> as well as <hi>Benjamin</hi> (who was ſo linkt to
<hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> that part of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and of the Temple ſtood in that Tribe) and let them ſee, by a <pb n="83" facs="tcp:40241:48"/>remarkable deliverance, that their zeal for the purity of their Religion, was acceptable to Him.</p>
                     <p>Another reaſon indeed there may be given (which I have not omitted in my Paraphraſe) why theſe <hi>three</hi> are joined together, rather then any other, becauſe they were the Tribes (as we reade in the
<hi>ſecond</hi> of <hi>Numbers</hi>) who, when they were in the Wilderneſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways marched behind the Tabernacle, when it moved; and had that part, where the Propitiatory was, from whence God ſent his Oracles, and the tokens of his power; juſt before them. But then there is this to be added, to make it probable that this Pſalm was not penned in the time of the Captivity; becauſe, as then there was no Ark; nor did God <hi>ſit between the Cherubins</hi> (concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which phraſe the learned Reader may ſee
<hi>Lud. de Dieu,</hi> upon 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> IV. 4.) as He is ſaid here to do; nor were <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> then mixed with them, that we reade of: ſo, <hi>firſt</hi> of all, it is too full of elegancies for that time of utter deſolation; and <hi>ſecondly</hi> the Greek expreſly calls it, <hi>A Pſalm concerning the Aſſyrian</hi> (who is the <hi>wild Boar</hi> I ſuppoſe that broke into God's Vineyard, mentioned Ver. 13.) and
<hi>laſtly, Hezekiah,</hi> I obſerve, applies himſelf to God (in the time of that diſtreſs by the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi>) in the very language of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt; and begins his Prayer, juſt as <hi>Aſaph</hi>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40241:54"/>the Ten Commandments; after which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> delivered them a body of civil Laws, <hi>Exod.</hi> XXI. XXII. XXIII. But they did not know the manner of the Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for which they came out of
<hi>Egypt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wilderneſs, till <hi>Moſes</hi> had been twice forty days, one after the other, in the Mount; and likewiſe (as ſeveral of the <hi>Jews</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe paſſages in IX. <hi>Deut.</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to this matter) had <hi>forty</hi> days more bewailed their ſin, in making the golden Calf. Which <hi>ſixſcore</hi> days, if we add to the time between their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the giving of the Law on Mount
<hi>Sinai,</hi> and to the <hi>ſix</hi> days, which paſſed before
<hi>Moſes</hi> was called up into the Cloud, it will fall out exactly to be the <hi>firſt day of the ſeventh month,</hi> when he began to give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the building of the Tabernacle, and making all things belonging to God's Houſe; according to the direction he had received in the Mount. I am ſure this was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe time of their ſetting up the Altar and beginning to offer burnt Offerings, after their return from the Captivity of
<hi>Babylon;</hi> before the foundation of the Temple was laid. For you reade III. <hi>Ezra</hi> 1, 6. it was upon the <hi>firſt</hi> day of the
<hi>ſeventh month;</hi> in the middle of which they alſo kept the Feaſt of Tabernacles, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had appointed; in memory of their dwelling in Booths in the Wilderneſs, under the Government of the <pb n="95" facs="tcp:40241:54"/>Almighty. The ſame day alſo was kept <hi>holy</hi> by
<hi>Nehemiah</hi> with great ſolemnity, VIII. 1, 8, 9, 10. where you find how the Book of the Law was diſtinctly read to the people on this day, and the ſenſe of it explained: ſo that they came the next day again for further inſtruction, Ver. 13.</p>
                     <p>Now that they might be more mindfull of thoſe Divine Benefits, which in this Month they commemorated, more then in any other Month in the Year, <hi>Aſaph</hi> (in the days of <hi>David</hi> it is likely) compoſed this Pſalm, and directed it to the Maſter of Muſick to be ſung (as the VIII. <hi>Pſalm</hi> upon <hi>Gittith</hi>) in the beginning of it, upon the Feaſt of Trumpets. And he introduces God Himſelf (before whom they were ſummoned, as I ſaid, by theſe Trumpets to appear) inſtructing them in the end of this Solemnity; and complaining of their forgetfulneſs of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, in giving them ſo great a deliverance out of the Egyptian ſlavery; and of their hard heartedneſs, in preferring their own Inventions, and the miſeries they brought thereby upon themſelves, before his Counſels, and the happineſs He intended for them. Which happineſs is expreſſed, in the laſt Verſe, by ſatisfying them with
<hi>honey out of the rock:</hi> concerning which the learned may conſult

<hi>Chr.</hi> XX. 1. And then the Authour of this Pſalm, muſt be either
<hi>Jehaziel</hi> one of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaph</hi>'s poſterity (upon whom you reade there, Ver. 14. the ſpirit of the Lord then came) or ſome other in thoſe days, whoſe proper name this was. Which is much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable then their conjecture, who think the Authour was <hi>Aſaph</hi> in the days of
<hi>David;</hi> who ſubdued indeed the <hi>Moabites</hi> and
<hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> and other neighbouring Nations: but we do not reade of any Confederacy they made againſt him; much leſs that they ſent as far as
<hi>Aſſyria</hi> for help; or that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the War as the people here mentioned did.</p>

                     <p>There are thoſe indeed that take in all the attempts made upon them, ſince that in <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi>'s days; by ſeveral Nations: the laſt of which was <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> whoſe King came to doe that which the reſt had not been able to effect. And then the Authour is eaſily found to be the ſame, that I have named; in the Argument of the foregoing, and many other Pſalms.

Which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred continuing after their return to their own Land, from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> gave occaſion to <hi>Theodoret</hi> to ſay (both in his Preface to this Pſalm, and upon the twelfth Verſe of it) that the Pſalmiſt here complains of the oppoſition, which ſeveral of <pb n="110" facs="tcp:40241:63"/>their neighbours made to the rebuilding of the Temple, and of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this ſeems more improbable than all the reſt, many of thoſe Countries, here na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, being before that time deſtroyed: and the

For though it was compoſed by <hi>David,</hi> when he was ſo perſecuted, either by <hi>Saul</hi> or <hi>Abſalom,</hi> that he was ſtript of all he had, and left in a moſt forlorn condition (Ver. 1.) yet
<hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> thinks it was made with a proſpect of the attempt, which the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> made upon <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and the hope which
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> then placed in God, for deliverance. Which Notion, it is likely he had from the <hi>Jews;</hi> who ſay that this <hi>Prayer</hi> was made uſe of by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in the time of that ſore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs: for the firſt words of this Pſalm, are the ſame with his in 2

                     <p>It is as uncertain when this <hi>Pſalm-Song</hi> (ſee LXVII.) was compoſed, as which of the Sons of <hi>Korah</hi> was the Authour of it. But it is manifeſt enough, that it was written in commendation of
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſituate in the holy Mountains; of <hi>Sion</hi> (where
<hi>David</hi> built his Palace, and afterward ſettled the Ark) and of
<hi>Moriah,</hi> where <hi>Solomon</hi> built the Temple. There are thoſe that think it <pb n="136" facs="tcp:40241:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>was compoſed upon the Anniverſary of the Birth, or Coronation of ſome great Prince; ſuch as
<hi>Hezekiah:</hi> in whoſe days this City was made more famous; by the glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance which God gave it, from the power of the King of
<hi>Aſſyria</hi>'s Army. But this is a mere conjecture; and I ſhall follow the vulgar opinion: according to which, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Pſalm muſt be lookt upon, as very abrupt; but expreſſes the greater rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of joyfull admiration, wherein the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt was.</p>

                     <p>Who this <hi>Heman</hi> was is uncertain. Not he who was the famous Singer in <hi>David</hi>'s time; for he was of the Tribe of
<hi>Levi</hi> (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> VI. 32. XV. 17.) whereas this was deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from <hi>Zerah,</hi> who was one of the Sons of <hi>Judah,</hi> 1
<hi>Chron.</hi> II. 6. where we find indeed not onely <hi>Heman,</hi> but
<hi>Ethan</hi> (to whom the next Pſalm is aſcribed) mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as two of
<hi>Zerah</hi>'s Sons: But we cannot reaſonably think that they were, in thoſe early times, the Authours of theſe two Pſalms; becauſe
<hi>Ethan</hi> plainly makes mention of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and the promiſe which God had paſſed to him of a perpetual Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>It remains therefore that theſe two here mentioned, were of the poſterity of thoſe Sons of <hi>Zerah</hi> (and thence called
<hi>Ezrahites</hi>) and had the Names of their noble Anceſtours gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, to perpetuate the memory of thoſe, who were ſo famous for wiſedom, 1
<hi>King.</hi> IV. 31.</p>
                     <p>But in what time they lived cannot be certainly determined. It is probable when <pb n="140" facs="tcp:40241:78"/>

                     <p>Why it is called a <hi>Song-Pſalm</hi> ſee upon the Title of <hi>Pſal.</hi> LXVII. It was to be ſung by the Sons of

<hi>Aſaph;</hi> ſo there are few of theſe, whoſe Authour is certainly known: and therefore, I ſuppoſe, were all put together, in one and the ſame Collection. The firſt of them indeed being made by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Hebrews have entertained a conceit (which Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> and Saint
<hi>Hilary</hi> alſo follow) that he was the Authour alſo of the
<hi>Ten</hi> next immediately inſuing. But, as there is no
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40241:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>reaſon for that (it will appear in due place) ſo I can ſee no cauſe why we ſhould fancy <hi>David,</hi> or ſome of the Children of <hi>Moſes</hi> in his time, or a <hi>ſinger</hi> of that name (as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> conjectures) to have compoſed this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Pſalm: when not onely the Title ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly gives it to that <hi>Moſes</hi> who was <hi>the Man of God</hi> (as their Law giver is called XXXIII.
<hi>Deut.</hi> 1.) or that famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, by whom God ſpake to them; but the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe, and the very matter of the Pſalm ſufficiently ſhew, that it was a Meditation of his, when the people offended ſo highly againſt God in the Wilderneſs (eſpecially by murmuring at the Relation the Spies brought them of the good Land, XIV.
<hi>Numb.</hi>) that He ſhortned their lives, to <hi>ſeventy</hi> or
<hi>eighty</hi> years at the moſt; and ſuffered them not to arrive at the age of their Anceſtours, or of <hi>Moſes, Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua:</hi> whoſe lives he prolonged to an <hi>hundred and twenty</hi> years.</p>
                     <p>Which grievous puniſhment <hi>Moſes</hi> prays God, they may lay to heart ſeriouſly, and ſo recover his favour, (Ver. 12,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) who is the eternal God, as he tells them (in the beginning of the Pſalm) and had been, in a particular manner, kind to their Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours in former Generations.</p>
                     <p>This is the ſubſtance of the Pſalm: which the Collectour of this Book, thought fit to place in the very beginning of it; becauſe of <pb n="166" facs="tcp:40241:92"/>the great antiquity of this Pſalm, and the dignity of its Authour.</p>

                     <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
                     <p>The Authour of this Pſalm is not known: but the occaſion ſeems to have been ſome great Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; in which the Pſalmiſt commends an humble confidence in God, and ardent love to Him, as the beſt ſecurity both in that, and in all other dangers. <hi>Maimonides</hi> thinks (as other of the Rabbins alſo do) that the Pſalmiſt hath a peculiar reſpect to the incurſions of evil ſpirits, Ver. 5, 6. as in the following Verſes, 7, 8. to thoſe miſchiefs which may come from the hand of evil men. And as far as thoſe Spirits had any hand in the Peſtilence here ſpoken of, his opinion is true; and his words in general are very ſignificant, that the Pſalmiſt here <hi>treats elegantly of that great Providence, which protects and keeps us from all evils, both univerſal and particular,</hi> &amp;c. Thus he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes in his <hi>More Nevochim</hi> Part III. Chap. 51. where we have the reaſon of that name which is given to this Pſalm by the <hi>Talmudiſts;</hi> who call it <hi>A Song of evil Spirits.</hi> See <hi>Buxtorf</hi> Lex. Talmud. in the word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>Now there is no Peſtilence ſo likely to have given occaſion to this Pſalm, as that in the latter end of <hi>David</hi>'s Reign: <pb n="174" facs="tcp:40241:96"/>who having numbred the people, and not made thoſe acknowledgments to God which the Law in that caſe preſcribed, (XXX.
<hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus</hi> 12.) had this ſad choice given him by the Prophet
<hi>Gad,</hi> whether he would be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for his negligence by Famine, or by the Sword of his Enemies, or by Peſtilence. And ſubmitting to the laſt (which God ſent a deſtroying Angel to inflict, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> XXIV. 15,
16.) was taught, it is not unlikely, by that Prophet, called <hi>David</hi>'s
<hi>Seer,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend himſelf to the Divine Protection, in the words of this Pſalm. For that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> himſelf was the Authour, as ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is not ſo probable; becauſe there is no ſuch confeſſion of his Sin, and depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine Diſpleaſure in this Pſalm, as we reade he made on that occaſion, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> XXIV. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXI. unleſs we will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he made this Pſalm after that Plague; to direct and excite all others, to make God their refuge, as he had done, in ſuch like calamities.</p>
                     <p>And this is far more probable, then that it ſhould be made by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as ſome of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews fancy; for none of the plagues in his time were ſo great as that in <hi>Davids:</hi> and the moſt of them fell on thoſe whom God had condemned to die in the Wilderneſs, (as he in the foregoing Pſalm commemorates) and therefore he could not promiſe long life to them upon any terms; as the Pſalmiſt <pb n="175" facs="tcp:40241:96"/>here doth to the man that confides in God, Ver. laſt.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Interpreters by <hi>Schacal</hi> (which commonly ſignifies a Lion) do ſo unanimouſly underſtand ſome kind of Serpent, and not without reaſon (as <hi>Bochartus</hi> hath demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated) that I have followed them, in my Paraphraſe of Verſe 13. and made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Beaſts of prey, but onely of venomous Creatures.</p>

                     <p>If Adam had made this Pſalm, preſently after he was created in the evening of the Sabbath (which is a Rabbinical fancy, mentioned in the <hi>Midraſh</hi> upon this place) ſure it would have been ſet in this <hi>fourth</hi> Book of Pſalms, before that of <hi>Moſes:</hi> who may more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be conceived to have compoſed it; to raiſe the hearts of the Iſraelites to the proper buſineſs of the <hi>Sabbath-day:</hi> which was to praiſe God, when they meditated upon his wonderfull works, not onely of Creation but of Providence in the government of the world. Several inſtances of which, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding the good, and puniſhing the wicked, they themſelves had ſeen ſince they came out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and were to ſee more when they came into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> to keep their <hi>Sabbath</hi> or

                     <p>But there is no certainty of theſe things, or rather it is certain that neither of theſe conjectures are true.

<hi>Jubal:</hi> ſo thoſe Inſtruments were not imployed in the ſervice of God till the days of <hi>David:</hi> who may therefore more reaſonably be thought to have made this <hi>Pſalm for the Sabbath,</hi> then either of the other; after God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him ſuch <hi>Reſt round about from all his enemies,</hi> (2 Sam.

                     <p>This Pſalm alſo wants a Title in the Hebrew: but the Greeks are juſtified in the former part of their Inſcription (which calls it <hi>An Ode of David</hi>'s) by the 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XVI. where we find, that at the bringing up the Ark from the houſe of <hi>Obed Edom,</hi> to the place he had prepared for it on Mount <hi>Sion;</hi> 
                        <pb n="205" facs="tcp:40241:113"/>
                        <hi>David</hi> delivered this Pſalm (together with the CV.) into the hand of <hi>Aſaph,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the joy he had in God's ſpecial preſence among them: which, all their neighbours round about, he foretells, ſhould be made ſenſible of, as well as themſelves.</p>
                     <p>This Pſalm indeed is not exactly the very ſame with that; but there is a difference in ſome expreſſions: <hi>ex. gr.</hi> it is called here <hi>A new Song,</hi> but not there; which ſhews it was afterward altered by ſome divine perſon, who accommodated it to other uſes. And very probably by <hi>Ezra,</hi> when they came out of
<hi>Babylon:</hi> which occaſioned the Greeks to add, in the latter part of the Inſcription of this Pſalm, theſe words; <hi>when the houſe was built after the Captivity. Ezra,</hi> that is, made uſe of it to expreſs their joy at the re-edification of the Temple.</p>
                     <p>But it never had a compleat fulfilling, anſwerable to the height of it, till the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> (who was indeed the Temple of God) came to dwell among us; to give eternal Salvation to us. Several of the Jewiſh Writers acknowledge that it belongs to His times: and accordingly we not onely may, but ought, to have Him in our minds, when we ſay <hi>Sing unto the Lord a new Song</hi> (for his new Grace, that is, in ſending Him to give Salvation to all Nations) and <hi>the Lord reigneth,</hi> Ver. 10. and hath all things put under his feet.

                     <p>Some of the Hebrews conceive (as I obſerved upon Pſalm XC.) that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of this, as well as the reſt of theſe Pſalms which want an Inſcription. And indeed he excelled in this faculty of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Hymns, as we learn from <hi>Exod.</hi> XV. and
<hi>Deut.</hi> XXXII. and might upon ſome other occaſion, as well as the overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the red Sea, make a Song of triumph, after ſome of thoſe great victories which God gave them over their enemies.

<hi>Amorites,</hi> after <hi>Sihon</hi> had taken <hi>Heſhbon</hi> from the

<hi>Numb.</hi> 27, &amp;c. And if we could be ſure this Pſalm was made by
<hi>Moſes,</hi> I ſhould think it to have been compoſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> had conquered <hi>Sihon</hi> and his Land: over whom they triumphed as he had done over the former poſſeſſours of that Country. But the Pſalm ſeems ſo plainly to have been compoſed, in purſuance of what was ſaid in the foregoing Pſalm, that <hi>the Lord reigneth,</hi> and is King, not onely over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but all the earth; that one cannot but think they had the ſame Authour: who ſhews the truth of that, by the illuſtrious Victories, which God, as their King, had given them over all thoſe that oppoſed them. For the <hi>eighth verſe</hi> makes it manifeſt that this Pſalm hath reſpect to ſome Conqueſts, they had lately made over the heathen: which, I ſuppoſe, were no other then thoſe which <hi>David</hi> won over divers Nations; not long after (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XVIII. 1.) he had brought the Ark to <hi>Sion,</hi> and delivered the foregoing Hymn to be ſung, to put the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> in hope, and their enemies in fear, of the great things which would inſue, upon this ſpecial preſence of God among them.</p>

<hi>Thankſgiving,</hi> and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, for Divine bleſſings; as the word is tranſlated below, Verſe 4. and in moſt other places. For which reaſon, I ſuppoſe, it is, that the Hebrews imagin (as the Chaldee Paraphraſe, as well as other of their Authours, tells us) it was peculiarly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be ſung, when their ſacrifices of thanksgiving were offered; mentioned VII. <hi>Levit.</hi> 12, 13. The Companies alſo or Quires of them, who gave thanks to God, are called by this Name, XII. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 31, 38. Which <pb n="227" facs="tcp:40241:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>makes it probable that the Levites ſang this Song upon that occaſion: which the Greeks think was made by
<hi>David:</hi> who invites all the world to join with the Iſraelites, in the ſervice of Him, who was kind and gracious to them beyond expreſſion Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we Chriſtians now properly uſe it, in acknowledgment of God's wonderfull love to us in Chriſt: by whom we offer up conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſpiritual ſacrifices; for redeeming us by the ſacrifice He made of himſelf, for making the world anew, and creating us again unto good works; according to his faithfull promiſes, which we may depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ever.</p>

                     <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
                     <p>The Title tells us who made this Pſalm; and the matter of it is ſo plain, that any body may ſee it is a pious reſolution of
<hi>David</hi> to govern firſt himſelf, and then his Court, and then his Kingdom, with ſo much care; that the good might expect all favour from him, but no wicked man, of any ſort, have the leaſt countenance or incouragement.</p>
                     <p>The onely difficulty is to know, when he compoſed it; whether before, or after he was ſettled in his Kingdom. The firſt words of it ſeem to countenance thoſe, who think he was poſſeſſed of it; and newly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon the Government: which he thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledges. But the words that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, verſe 2. <hi>O when wilt Thou come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me,</hi> ſeem to juſtifie their opinion who think he was now under <hi>Saul</hi>'s perſecution: yet, having confidence in God's promiſes (which he long'd to ſee fulfilled) made this religious Vow, of being a good King; and propoſed to himſelf an excellent form and manner of life, when God ſhould be pleaſed to perform them. To reconcile both theſe, there is a middle way lies open to every ones <pb n="231" facs="tcp:40241:126"/>view, that reads his hiſtory. For upon the death of <hi>Saul</hi> he was immediately promoted to the Kingdom; though not intirely: but reſolved then with himſelf how well he would govern; when God ſhould make him King over all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as He had done over <hi>Judah.</hi> And ſo I ſhall order my Paraphraſe, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him to reign now in <hi>Hebron,</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> II. 1, 2,
3, 4.) and expecting to reign in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (2 <hi>Sam</hi> V. 3, 4,
5.) which I preſume he here calls <hi>the City of God,</hi> Ver. 8. becauſe there he intended to ſettle the Ark, as well as to fix his Court; when he ſhould be poſſeſſed of it.</p>
                     <p>That paſſage indeed hath induced ſome to think, that he compoſed this Pſalm, after he had made an attempt to bring the Ark thither; but failing in it, (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> VI. 9, 10.) ſighs here for its enjoyment. Which I ſhall not diſpute; becauſe I would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long this preface unneceſſarily. It is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in my judgment to ſay; that it doth not ſeem likely, he would defer this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo long after he was inſtalled in his Kingdom. For it required time, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for the reception of the Ark, ſutable to the Majeſty it repreſented.</p>

                     <p>The Title tells us this Pſalm is one of <hi>Davids:</hi> and the third, fourth and fifth Verſes may ſatisfie us, that he compoſed it, after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, from a dangerous ſickneſs, to ſuch a vigorous health; as the Eagles have, when they renew their plumes. To that he alludes Ver. 5. as <hi>Euthymius</hi> and Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> underſtand it. The latter of which ſays, upon XL. <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that he had often taught, the Eagles do no otherway return to youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, when they are old; but onely <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatione pennarum</hi> by change of their fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. I have expreſſed this a little more largely then ordinary, in the Paraphraſe (as I have done in the reſt of the Pſalm) to fit it the better to their uſe now, that have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the like danger: who ſhould take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when they thank God for ſuch a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to imitate <hi>David;</hi> in making a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full commemoration of the reſt of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: both to him and to others; both in the preſent and in paſt ages.

                     <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
                     <p>The foregoing and the following Pſalm being certainly compoſed by <hi>David,</hi> the Greeks, and from them ſeveral other ancient inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, have aſcribed this alſo to the ſame Authour. For which they had this further reaſon; that it begins (as <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) juſt as the foregoing Pſalm ends: and celebrates the mighty power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, in the fabrick of the world; as the CIII. doth his benefits to himſelf, and to the reſt of the children of men.</p>
                     <p>As for the occaſion of it, we may look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a probable opinion, that when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> thought of building a Houſe for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, and God ſent <hi>Nathan</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him; (2
<hi>Sam.</hi> VII. 5.) he fell not long after into the contemplation of the Majeſty of God; who having built this great world, as his Temple, needed none of his erecting; though He would be pleaſed to accept one for the burning Sacrifice before Him, as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> afterward ſpeaks 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> II. 6. To ſtrengthen this conjecture of mine, it may be obſerved; that he begins this Pſalm, with ſuch an Admiration of God's moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perfection, as we meet withall in <hi>David</hi>'s prayer; immediately after God <pb n="255" facs="tcp:40241:138"/>had certified him of his love towards him, though he would not let him build Him an Houſe 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> VII. 22. <hi>Thou art great, O Lord, for there is none like unto Thee.</hi> In the ſame manner he ſaith here, <hi>O Lord my God, Thou art very great:</hi> as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to demonſtrate, from his wonderfull works. And firſt he begins with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the Clouds and the Angels: and then comes down to the Earth, the Sea, the Mountains, Valleys, Fountains and other inferiour things: Which depend ſo much upon the Sun, the Moon and heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; that all of them together declare the moſt admirable wiſedom of Him by whom they were compoſed: and ſhould excite all mankind to his perpetual praiſes.</p>

                     <p>Though this Pſalm have no Title, yet we are aſſured by what we reade in the 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XVI. 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the firſt part of it, at leaſt (to the end of Ver. 15.) was made by
<hi>David;</hi> and delivered by Him to <hi>Aſaph</hi> and his Brethren, for the conſtant ſervice of God in the Tabernacle: when, after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Victories over the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> (1 <hi>Chr.</hi> XIV.) he had ſettled the Ark of God in <hi>Sion.</hi> And it is moſt probable that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward inlarged this Pſalm (for who elſe would adventure to doe it?) that it might be a more compleat commemoration of all the mercies of God, towards their Nation; from the days of <hi>Abraham</hi> to their taking poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Into <pb n="268" facs="tcp:40241:146"/>which he ſhews, their gracious Lord conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them by ſo many miraculous providences, in ſeveral ages (according to his faithfull promiſe, made to <hi>Abraham</hi> his faithfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant) that it deſerved their moſt hearty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments: to which he excites them, by <hi>ten</hi> ſeveral expreſſions, in the <hi>five</hi> firſt verſes of the Pſalm.</p>
                     <p>To which the Greeks praefix an <hi>Hallelujah</hi> (for they take the laſt word of the foregoing Pſalm, and ſet it on the head of this) as a note how much they were obliged to <hi>praiſe the Lord,</hi> according to that exhortation; when they remembred, in this Pſalm, the benefits, that He had beſtowed upon their Forefathers: which were ſufficient to excite and whet their minds, to the imitation of their vertue.</p>
                     <p>And it may ſerve to admoniſh the new people of God, (as
<hi>Theodoret</hi> ſpeaks) that is, us Chriſtians, how much we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in God's goodneſs to us; and how dangerous it is to be ungratefull to Him: which provoked Him to deprive the <hi>Jews</hi> of that fatherly care which He had taken of their Anceſtours.</p>

                     <p>There is little doubt to be made, but this is the Title of the Pſalm, as it is of many other, (CXI, &amp;c.) whereby the Authour excites them to acknowledge God's bounty to their ungratefull Forefathers. For as in the foregoing Pſalm (they are the words of <hi>Theodoret</hi>) the Divine Benefits are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated; <pb n="285" facs="tcp:40241:154"/>ſo in this the Pſalmiſt both commemorates them, and alſo upbraids the ingratitude of thoſe that received them. Which magnified the mercies of God the more; in being ſo very kind to thoſe wicked people, that when He puniſhed them, He did not utterly deſtroy them.</p>
                     <p>The opinion of that Father is, that the Pſalm was compoſed in the perſon of the more pious ſort of people; who bewail the common calamities, and implore the Divine indulgence. And moſt Interpreters, that I have met withall, imagin it to have been made in the time of the Captivity of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon:</hi> but the proof of it is very weak. For the laſt verſe but one, upon which they ground that conjecture, may have another conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and mean no more but this: that God would be pleaſed when the Nation, or any part of it, ſhould be carried captive, to take pity upon them; and reſtore them again to their Country. Or rather, in my opinion, it refers to thoſe who, in the days of <hi>Saul,</hi> or before, were taken priſoners by the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines,</hi> and other Nations: whom
<hi>David</hi> prays God to gather to their own Land again; that they might worſhip Him in that place, which He had prepared for the Ark of his preſence. For it ſeems plain enough, that this was one of the Pſalms, which he delivered then to <hi>Aſaph:</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> verſe and the <hi>two laſt</hi> being ſet down in the <pb n="286" facs="tcp:40241:155"/>1
<hi>Chron.</hi> XVI. 36, 37, as the beginning and ending of another Pſalm, (which can be none but this) which he then gave in with the other two there mentioned, (XCVI. and CV.) to praiſe the Lord withall.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> Book of Pſalms (which conſiſts moſt of Praiſes and Thanksgivings) begins here; with an exhortation to thoſe whom God (according to the Prayer foregoing CVI. 47.) had delivered from Pagan ſervitude, to acknowledge that ſingular benefit with their hearty Thanksgivings: and thence to take occaſion to magnifie his mercifull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over all other men, not onely of that but of all Nations, when they addreſſed themſelves unto Him in their diſtreſſes. For inſtance, Travellers in the deſart who have loſt their way, Priſoners, Sick people, Mariners, Husbandmen, even whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries the Pſalmiſt ſhews are made ſtrangely proſperous, if they have a regard to God; <pb n="306" facs="tcp:40241:165"/>and on the other ſide fall into great miſery, if they neglect Him. It had been endleſs to enumerate all other caſes; but by theſe any man may underſtand, if he pleaſe (as he obſerves in the concluſion) how good the Lord is, and ready to help thoſe who fly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him for ſuccour, whatſoever their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be.</p>
                     <p>The Authour of the Pſalm is unknown; but if I have gueſſed aright at the connexion of this with the foregoing Pſalm, it is moſt probable it was compoſed by <hi>David:</hi> who having in the CV. put them in mind (as <hi>Theodoret</hi> obſerves) of the promiſes made to the Patriarchs, and of the bleſſings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on their poſterity; and in the CVI. of their horrid ingratitude for ſuch benefits, and the puniſhments, for that cauſe, inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon them: declares in this Pſalm the inexplicable kindneſs of God, in their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from ſlavery; and in his carefull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as I ſaid, over all mankind: which might give them the greater incouragement to hope in Him, if they ſerved Him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, who had taken them for his peculiar people.</p>

<hi>Peter,</hi> I. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. applies the eighth Verſe of this Pſalm. The reſt of which is ſpent in Prayer to God, againſt ſuch falſe accuſers; and in vows of the Praiſes he would give Him, when he was delivered from the miſchief, which thereby they deſigned to him. Accordingly, when he was ſettled in his Throne, he ſent this Pſalm among others, unto the Maſter of Muſick in the Tabernacle; to perpetuate the memory of God's mercy to him.</p>

                     <p>There is the ſame reaſon to think this Pſalm was compoſed by <hi>David</hi> (not by ſome other concerning <hi>David</hi>) that there is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all the reſt to be ſo, which have the ſame Title. And then, as it is very plain he ſpeaks of ſome perſon much greater then himſelf, whom he calls his <hi>Lord,</hi> ſo it can be no other, but the <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> of whom he here propheſies. Not, as he is wont to doe elſewhere, with reſpect to himſelf in the firſt place, as His type and figure; but in plain words, which can belong to none but
<hi>Chriſt</hi> alone. For no other King but He, can be ſaid, in any ſenſe, to ſit at God's right hand: nor was there any Prieſt of the order of <hi>Melchiſedek,</hi> that could be a ſhadow of him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> indeed ſeems once to have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:40241:181"/>the Office of a Prieſt, when he <hi>bleſſed the people,</hi> at the bringing of the Ark to <hi>Sion,</hi> (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> VI.
18.) and ſo to have been then both King and Prieſt, in one perſon, as
<hi>Melchifedek</hi> was: but not a <hi>Prieſt for ever,</hi> on whom the Office was perpetually eſtabliſhed, and that <hi>by an Oath;</hi> as it was on the Prieſt here mentioned.</p>
                     <p>And therefore it is in vain, to endeavour to accommodate any part of this Pſalm to <hi>David;</hi> who conquered many of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countries, ſmote their Kings, made them bring him tributes, and at laſt ſmote <hi>the head of the Country of Rabbah</hi> (as ſome render the laſt words of the <hi>ſixth verſe</hi> of this Pſalm) that is, the King of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Ammon:</hi> But ſtill we are to ſeek, how the reſt can be applied to him; who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any pretence to ſuch an authority as is here deſcribed; nor can in any ſenſe call himſelf, my Lord; but as our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath demonſtrated ſpake concerning Him, (XXII.
<hi>Matt.</hi> 43, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and his Exaltation, after his Reſurrection from the dead, (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſhew, II. <hi>Act.</hi> 34, 35. 1 <hi>Cor</hi> XV. 25. IV.
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 1, 13. V. 6.) when He ſet up another Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and aboliſhed that of <hi>Moſes:</hi> which change is here predicted.</p>
                     <p>And though the <hi>Jews</hi> have taken a great deal of pains, to wreſt this Pſalm to another ſenſe; yet they are ſo divided in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions <pb n="337" facs="tcp:40241:181"/>about it, (ſpeaking inconſiſtent things, like drunken men, as Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s words are, or rather, ſays he, like men in the dark, running againſt one another) that from thence alone we may be ſatisfied they are in the wrong, and have their eyes blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: elſe they would not have embraced ſuch interpretations, as thoſe which may be ſeen in them, that have written upon this Pſalm.

                     <p>It is certain this is the Title of the Pſalm: which conſiſts of as many ſhort Metres as there are Letters in the Hebrew Alphabet; and therefore cannot begin with <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> whoſe firſt Letter is the <hi>fifth,</hi> not the firſt Letter in that Alphabet. In which order it proceeds for the better help of the memory: being compoſed thus artificially, that every one, as well as the ſingers (to whom the
<hi>Hallelujah</hi> perhaps is particularly directed) might have in their minds a brief form of thanking God (eſpecially upon feſtival days) for the wonderfull things He had done for that Nation.</p>
                     <p>It was a meditation which the Authour had in time of peace and quiet; for in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, or immediately after a great delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, mens ſpirits are not at liberty to uſe ſuch art and curioſity in their compoſures, as there is in this Pſalm: being full, at <pb n="342" facs="tcp:40241:184"/>thoſe ſeaſons, of ſuch paſſions, as make them neglect it, even when they are inclined to uſe it. (ſee <hi>Pſalm</hi> XXV.) For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I think <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s opinion hath no ground; that the Pſalmiſt hath reſpect to the great Victory obtained by
<hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> over the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and other Nations, who invaded his Kingdom: for which they gave thanks to God, preſently after, 2
<hi>Chr.</hi> XX. It is more likely that <hi>David</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed thoſe larger forms of commemoration, <hi>Pſalm</hi> CV. and CVI. made this (as I ſaid) for a compendious remembrance of what is there more largely delivered. And that He might not exceed the number of the Ten Commandments (as ſome give the reaſon of it) in the Verſes of this Pſalm, the Metres of the two laſt are ſo ſhort; that they have, each of them, <hi>three</hi> Letters of the Alphabet in them, whereas all the former have but <hi>two.</hi>

For that it was written after he had brought the Ark to
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned there Chap. VI.) and placed it in the
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:40241:200"/>Houſe he had prepared for it; ſeems very plain from Ver. 19. of this Pſalm: Where he begins to praiſe God in ſuch words, as had not their compleat fulfilling till the Lord's <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (whom the

                     <p>And as the latter part of the Pſalm is a Prophecy of

21. After which all the people ſhout, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Divine Goodneſs; in making him, who was baniſhed from his Country, their King, Ver. 22,

<hi>eight</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and every one of thoſe verſes begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with that Letter, wherewith that Part begins. The Verſes, for inſtance, of the Firſt Part all begin with <hi>Aleph,</hi> or A; and all of the Second with
<hi>Beth,</hi> or B, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thence this Pſalm is called in the

Now all theſe things, ſays he (and it is not improbable) <hi>David</hi> afterward collected into this one Pſalm; connecting all the Prayers
<q rend="inline">"which He had made to God, at ſeveral times and on ſeveral occaſions, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them together in this admirable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, divided into XXII.

                     <p>This Pſalm ſeems to have been compoſed by ſome holy man; after God had given com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to <hi>David,</hi> by <hi>Gad</hi> the
<hi>Seer,</hi> to build an Altar in the threſhing-floor of <hi>Arau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> the <hi>Jebuſite;</hi> (where the deſtroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſtood) and the Lord had anſwered him by fire upon that Altar, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXI. 18, 26. whereby <hi>David</hi> knew, what he had till now been ignorant of, that this was the place where God would be worſhipped and have his Temple built, XXII.
1. Accordingly we reade expreſly, that <hi>Solomon</hi> therefore built the Temple in this place; becauſe God here appeared to <hi>David</hi> his father, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> deſigned and prepared this place for it: (2
<hi>Chron.</hi> III. 1.) that there God's habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation might be fixed; and not removed, from place to place, uncertainly, as it had been in former times. For the Tabernacle, which the Hebrews call <hi>Miſchkan,</hi> had been in an unſettled condition, except one period of time, ever ſince they came into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> It was firſt pitched in <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and ſtaid there 24. years. Then it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>Shiloh,</hi> where it remained, to the <pb n="478" facs="tcp:40241:254"/>death of <hi>Eli,</hi> 369. years. After his death, <hi>Shiloh</hi> being laid waſte, it was tranſlated to
<hi>Nob:</hi> where it remained, they ſay, 13. years: (but was now no better then a Cabinet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its Jewel; the Ark being in another place and never reſtored to it, after that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of <hi>Shiloh;</hi> ſee
<hi>Pſal.</hi> LXVIII.) And then it was carried to <hi>Gibeon,</hi> where
<hi>Solomon</hi> found it, and from thence fetcht it, when he had finiſhed the Temple. Which the Hebrews therefore call <hi>Beth Olamim,</hi> the eternal Houſe; becauſe it was fixed to a place, and out of it the Ark never depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as it had done out of the Tabernacle: but there (as the Pſalmiſt here ſpeaks Verſe 14.) the Lord took up <hi>his reſt for ever:</hi> Never to depart, that is, to any other place, till the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> came; who was <hi>the Temple of God, in whom the fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwelt bodily.</hi>

                     <p>There are thoſe that think <hi>Solomon</hi> pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this Pſalm; becauſe (in the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> VI. the two laſt Verſes) he concludes his prayer, at the conſecration of the Temple, with ſome part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Ver. 8, 9, 10. And truly, ſince he ſpeaks as if the Prieſts were juſt taking up the Ark to carry it into this reſting place, and there begs that God would not, for <hi>David</hi>'s ſake, turn away the face of his Anointed, (<hi>i.e.</hi> refuſe to hear his prayer) it is not an improbable conjecture: which I ſhall follow in my Paraphraſe.

                     <p>When there was no other ſtrife among all the Tribes of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> then who ſhould be moſt forward in returning to their allegiance; and the Children of <hi>Judah</hi> alſo were incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as one man to bring back <hi>David</hi> to his Kingdom, from which his Son
<hi>Abſalom</hi> had driven him, (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> XIX. 9, 14.) he fell into a rapturous admiration of that happy unity and concord: which he commended to them afterwards in this Pſalm, as their beſt preſervative and ſecurity in future ages. This ſeems to me more probable to be the occaſion of it, then the concurrence of all the Tribes to make him King after <hi>Saul</hi>'s death, (which is the common account that is given of it) for then <hi>Sion</hi> was not in his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and it is not likely he would then have made ſuch mention of it as he doth here, while it remained in the hands of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſites.</hi> But whatſoever was the firſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it was aptly applied to their condition after the return of their Captivity from
<hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon;</hi> when, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> notes, the Tribes, which had been divided by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> were then again

It recounts ſeveral of the great works of the Lord; eſpecially towards that Nation: <pb n="490" facs="tcp:40241:260"/>whom it excites to ſtedfaſtneſs in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and to contempt of Idols and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

CXI, &amp;c.) <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> or <hi>Praiſe the Lord.</hi> That is, by this Hymn ſet forth the moſt excellent perfections, and works of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>There are thoſe who conjecture, from what we reade Ver.
14. of this Pſalm, that when it was compoſed they were (or rather, had been lately) infeſted by ſome of their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous neighbours. Whoſe gods the Pſalmiſt derides in the very ſame manner as he doth Pſalm CXV. For the

                     <p>This Pſalm, like the former, is a commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the goodneſs of God, expreſſed in his wonderfull works: particularly thoſe He had done for that Nation. And, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was compoſed to be ſung upon the great Feſtivals; as every day I ſuppoſe they ſung the foregoing: which is of the ſame ſtrain with this, and contains much of the ſame matter: onely here, at every half Verſe, one half of the Quire anſwers to the other in theſe words; <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> A form of acknowledgment preſcribed by <hi>David</hi> to be uſed continually in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XVI. 41: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly followed by <hi>Solomon,</hi> 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> VII. 3, 6. when he dedicated the Temple; and by <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> when by the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:40241:264"/>of a Prophet he went out to incounter a vaſt Army with ſmall Forces, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XX. 21. and here is repeated <hi>ſix and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> times, to make them the more ſenſible that they owed all they had to the mere bounty of God; and to excite them to depend intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon it; and reſt aſſured it would never fail them if they did piouſly and moſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily acknowledge it. Such repetitions we uſe now in our earneſt Prayers, when we ſay; <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> &amp;c. which are no more vain then theſe. I have variouſly expreſſed the ſenſe of this repeated acknowledgment, according as the other part of the ſeveral verſes ſeemed to direct me.</p>

                     <p>The Inſcription will not let us doubt, that <hi>David</hi> was the Authour of this Pſalm: but that it was a Triumph after his victory over <hi>Goliath</hi> (as the <hi>vulgar Latine</hi> hath it) is aſſerted without ground. For though ſome Greek Copies have ſuch an addition to the Inſcription; yet <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſays, that as he could find it in the Hebrew, ſo it was not to be met withall in any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters; no not in the LXX. in the <hi>Hexaplus.</hi> And it plainly appears by the
<hi>ſecond</hi> Verſe that it was compoſed after he came to the Kingdome: and not then, till he had got ſome victories over thoſe that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him. Nay, there are ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions here, like to thoſe we meet withall in the XVIII. Pſalm; that it hath incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſome to think, it was made at the ſame time, and for the ſame purpoſe with that: of which it looks like a compendium, and might be intended for a ſhort form of
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:40241:289"/>thanksgiving, for his deliverance from all his Enemies. But if the expreſſions be carefully examined, their opinion will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be truer, who think it was compoſed, not after God had given him reſt from all his Enemies; but after thoſe two victories over the
<hi>Philiſtines,</hi> mentioned 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> V. if not before them: For as he ſtill men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more oppoſers, who were unſubdued, v. 7, 11; ſo he doth not ſay, as in the XVIII. Pſalm, that God had caſt forth lightnings, and ſhot his arrows againſt them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but deſires Him here (v. 5, 6.) that He would appear in that manner for him: acknowledging that not onely his Kingdome, but his Courage, his Victories, and Succeſſes were all to be aſcribed unto God.</p>

                     <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
                     <p>After <hi>David</hi> had obtained theſe favours of God for himſelf and for the Nation, which he begs in the foregoing Pſalm; he compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (according to his promiſe there Ver. 9.) this admirable Hymn: which is contrived with ſuch Art, that, it is manifeſt from thence, he made it when he was much at leaſure; and God had given him reſt from all his enemies: (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> VII. 1.) For every Verſe begins with a new Letter of the Alphabet in order: which are all here, except the Letter <hi>Nun;</hi> which is wanting, Verſe 13. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it was loſt, when this Pſalm came to the hands of the Collectour of this Book: and he would not adventure to ſupply it, with one of his own inventing. The <hi>Greek</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (that is, the preſent Greek Copies; for <hi>Theodotion,</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient LXX. had it not) and <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> (which in effect are but one and the ſame) have another Verſe, which we may well think, if it ever were in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> began with that Letter
<hi>Nun:</hi> But it differs ſo little from the ſeventeenth Verſe (when there is no repetition, in any other part <pb n="557" facs="tcp:40241:293"/>of the Pſalm) that it doth not, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, look like the true original Verſe. And it may be doubted, whether there ever was any ſuch Verſe in that place (where we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one wanting) for the Pſalmiſt might be carried (ſee
<hi>Pſalm</hi> XXV.) by the ſtrength of the inſpiration, which was upon him, out of the method he had at firſt propoſed to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Certain it is, this Pſalm was always eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſo excellent, that the Title of the whole Book of Pſalms, is taken from this: which is wholly ſpent in praiſing God, with ſuch admirable devotion; that the ancient <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> were wont to ſay (as <hi>Valentine Schindler</hi> hath long ago obſerved) <hi>He could not fail to be a child of the world to come, who would ſay this Pſalm three times every day.</hi> And for that reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it was compoſed Alphabetically; that ſo uſefull a Pſalm might be the more eaſily learnt, and remembred by every body.</p>

                     <p>It doth not appear who was the Authour of this Hymn, nor upon what occaſion it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. But the laſt Verſe ſufficiently ſhews the Nation was then in a very flouriſhing condition; and therefore probably it was made by <hi>David;</hi> when God had given him reſt from all his Enemies: which filled his heart with ſuch love to God, that it tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported him into this rapture. Wherein, finding how ſhort his own praiſes were, he wiſhes all Creatures in heaven and earth would conſpire in a ſweet ſymphony, as <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi> ſpeaks, of ſinging Hymns unto Him. And <hi>firſt</hi> he calls upon the world above, and all that is therein from the <hi>firſt</hi> Verſe to the <hi>ſeventh:</hi> where he deſcends to the world here below; and calls upon all things on the earth to praiſe the Lord: concluding (v. 13.) that as there is one Maker of both; ſo all that they can ſay of Him, when they have joyned all their powers together in one Quire, falls infinitely ſhort of his moſt excellent Majeſty. Who hath ſet forth his moſt tranſcendent wiſdome, power, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, in ſuch variety of ſtupendious <pb n="581" facs="tcp:40241:305"/>work, that there is not the ſmalleſt of them, but miniſters ſuch matter of praiſe, nay admiration, to thoſe that attentively conſider them; that they cannot but wiſh with the Pſalmiſh here, that every one of them were able to tell us, how much skill, and kindneſs He hath ſhown in their contrivance: or that we were able to find it out, and comprehend it. Thus He is to be underſtood when he calls upon all Creatures to praiſe the Lord: or it is as if he had ſaid,
<hi>The Lord is to be praiſed by</hi> or <hi>in</hi> all theſe things, as long as the world laſts.</p>
                     <p>This I take to be the true account of this Pſalm, which I refer to the times of <hi>David,</hi> becauſe the two following ſeem to have been then made; and there is no other we can ſo well fix upon: unleſs we will conceive that it was a Meditation, when they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſettled in a peaceable enjoyment of their Religion, after the Captivity; of which there is not the leaſt intimation in the Pſalm.</p>

<hi>Levites,</hi> (by <hi>David</hi> I ſuppoſe) whoſe office it was to praiſe the Lord with muſical Inſtruments, (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XVI. 4, 5.) and excite others to his praiſes, not onely for Victory; but for all other his benefits. For if the Tradition of the <hi>Jews</hi> be true, which we reade at large in <hi>Maimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides,</hi> (in a Treatiſe on that ſubject) when the people of any place brought up their firſt fruits to preſent them to the Lord at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> (according to the Law, XXVI. <hi>Deut.</hi>) with a pipe going before them; as ſoon as they came to the mountain of the Temple, every one took his basket into his hand, and ſung this whole Pſalm: till they came to the courts of the Lord's houſe; where the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> met them ſinging the XXX. <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed it might well be uſed upon occaſion of any exceeding great joy; for it <pb n="593" facs="tcp:40241:311"/>ſeems to be intended (by the repetition of theſe words <hi>praiſe the Lord,</hi> or <hi>praiſe Him; thirteen</hi> times; and by the calling for no leſs then <hi>ten</hi> Inſtruments of Muſick) to expreſs the height and fulneſs of their joy, and thankfulneſs to God for his benefits: nor can Muſick be ſo well imployed to any other uſe, as this Divine and heavenly exerciſe of praiſing God, by Hymns, and Pſalms, and ſpiritual Songs: to which the Pſalmiſt ſeems to me to excite all Creatures, in heaven and in earth; from the higheſt to the loweſt. And with this the Collectour of theſe
<hi>five Books</hi> of Pſalms, thought good to conclude the whole; and not unfitly: For in whatſoever condition we be (as there are Pſalms adapted to ſeveral purpoſes) we ſhould never forget to praiſe the Lord; but after we have prayed, or complained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſtill end with thankfull acknowledgments to God for his goodneſs to us.</p>
